# Jennifer (Jenny) Coulter
I'm a PhD candidate in Applied Physics working in the [MIR group](https://mir.g.harvard.edu/) led by Prof. Boris Kozinsky at Harvard Unversity. My PhD research was funded by the DoE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (CSGF) from 2017-2021. I earned my B.S. in physics from Rutgers University in 2017.

## Interests
* I'm broadly interested in contributing to computational materials science/condensed matter physics software and method development efforts.

* Currently, most of my work focuses on computational techniques to predict transport in bulk materials as a developer of the Phoebe code (a high-performance framework for phonon and electron Boltzmann transport equation solutions).
You can learn more about the Phoebe package by checking out its [github repository](https://github.com/mir-group/phoebe) or the [code release manuscript here](https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2515-7639/ac86f6). 
In addition to method and software developement for transport through the Phoebe code, I study the impact of different scattering processes on thermal/electrical conductivities and thermoelectric properties.

* I'm also currently collaborating with the Hughes group @ UIUC to functionalize xene materials to realize useful topological interfacial modes.

* Outside of research, I'm a co-chair of the Harvard Women in Physics group. In the past at Rutgers University, I received an APS Women in Physics group grant to form an undergraduate group there.
