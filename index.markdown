# Jennifer (Jenny) Coulter

I'm a Flatiron Research Fellow at the [Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ)](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-quantum-physics/).

Previously:
 * PhD in Applied Physics from the [Kozinsky group](https://mir.g.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Unversity in 2023.
 * Department of Energy (DOE) Computational Science Graduate Fellow (CSGF) from 2017-2021.
 * B.S. in physics from Rutgers University in 2017.

## Interests
I'm generally interested in computational materials science/condensed matter physics method development efforts.
My work focuses on **predicting the transport properties of materials.**

* I'm currently interested in **understanding how electronic correlations and electron-phonon interactions can cooperate to alter the transport properties of materials.**
  
* **I'm the main developer of the Phoebe code** (a high-performance framework for Phonon and Electron Boltzmann transport Equation solutions).
  * You can learn more about Phoebe through its [documentation](https://phoebe.readthedocs.io/en/develop/introduction.html) or the [manuscript](https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2515-7639/ac86f6).
  * For questions about using Phoebe, open a [git discussion](https://github.com/mir-group/phoebe/discussions) or email me directly. 
<br/><br/>
* **I've also developed methods for novel transport predictions and studied transport in specific materials.**
  * I've predicted electrical, thermal, and thermoelectric properties for applications.
    * Thermoelectric properties of Ni3Ge. (2025). [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04891)    
  * I'm interested in understanding exotic transport phenomena such as hydrodynamic transport.
