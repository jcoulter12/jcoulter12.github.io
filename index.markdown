## About
I'm a PhD candidate in Applied Physics working in the [MIR group](https://mir.g.harvard.edu/) led by Prof. Boris Kozinsky at Harvard Unversity. My PhD research was funded by the DoE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (CSGF) from 2017-2021. I earned my B.S. in physics from Rutgers University in 2017.

## Research interests
Currently, my work focuses on computational techniques to predict transport in bulk materials.
As a developer of the Phoebe code (a high-performance framework for phonon and electron Boltzmann transport equation solutions),
I study the impact of different scattering processes on thermal/electrical conductivities and thermoelectric properties.
You can learn more about the Phoebe package by checking out its [github repository](https://github.com/mir-group/phoebe).

I'm also broadly interested in contributing to computational materials science/condensed matter physics software and method development efforts.
